This folder contains data used for training and evaluating a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model for the Twi language, with a focus on low-resource African NLP.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- `raw/`: Contains the original, unprocessed text scraped from publicly available sources.
- `processed/`: Contains annotated files in CoNLL format, suitable for training and evaluation.

## üìö Data Source

The original text was scraped from [worldstories.org.uk](https://worldstories.org.uk/reader/kweku-anansi-and-his-new-wife/akan/490), which provides free, open-access folktales in different languages for educational purposes.
Additional sentences were extracted from the Akan folktale "Ab…õn a …õgyee Ananse nkwa no" found in the paper:
Akrofi, E. (2023). Akan Ananses…õm: Ab…õn a …õgyee Ananse nkwa no. Academia.edu.
